# Eurojackpot Foreteller
A very scientifically accurate tool for predicting the next Eurojackpot numbers. Based on actual probability calculus and draw history.

**How it works:**
- The program scrapes number statistics (frequencies etc.) from https://www.euro-jackpot.net/en/statistics/number-frequency.
- Basic probability logic: when a number hasn't appeared for a while, every draw it's chances of appearing in the next draw will increase. The program calculates the most probable numbers and sorts them by chance percentage using probability calculus.
- The app will filter the most probable numbers by the "2/3 even, 2/3 odd, 2/3 high, 2/3 low -logic". More info here: https://lotterycodex.com/eurojackpot-550/
